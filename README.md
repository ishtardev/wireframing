# Wireframing
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure.

## Types of Wireframes.
### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Simple sketches that show the main layout and ideas.  
Used early in the design to plan structure and get quick feedback.  

**Example:** Hand-drawn screens or box layouts.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
More detailed and realistic versions showing spacing, text, and some visuals.  
Used later to test interactions and design flow.  

**Example:** Interactive wireframes made in Figma or Adobe XD.

## Popular Wireframing Tools

### Figma
Figma is a **cloud-based design tool** for creating wireframes and prototypes.

**Features:**
- Real-time team collaboration  
- Ready-to-use components  
- Interactive prototypes  
- Works in the browser  

**Why use it:**  
Figma makes it easy for designers and developers to work together and share feedback before development starts.
Wireframing helps teams **plan and agree on the design** before building the product.

## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development
- Clear communication between designers and developers  
- Detects issues early  
- Saves time and effort  
- Improves teamwork and understanding  

**Example:** In a booking app, wireframes can show how users search and book rooms clearly before coding begins.

## Real-World Scenario: Finding Usability Issues

In **Airbnb’s early design phase**, wireframing helped identify a major usability issue.  
During testing, users struggled to find the **“Book Now”** button because it was placed too low on the property page.

### How Airbnb Tested Without Code
Even though no code was written, designers created **interactive wireframes** using tools like **Figma**.  
These wireframes looked like real app screens and allowed users to click through them to simulate navigation.

**Process:**
1. Designers built the main screens (search, property details, checkout) as wireframes.  
2. They linked buttons and screens together for user testing.  
3. Test users tried booking a stay.  
4. Observers noticed that many missed the “Book Now” button.

To fix this, the team **moved the button higher** near the price section and added a progress bar to show booking steps.

**Result:**  
Users booked faster and made fewer mistakes.  
This usability issue was discovered and solved **before coding began**, saving time and development costs.

**Conclusion:**  
This example shows how **wireframing and prototyping** allow usability testing early in the design process.  
By fixing problems at the wireframe stage, teams ensure smoother user experiences and reduce costly changes later.
